## Outcome Prediction in Health Care

### Meeting Note - 1

The baseline will only include dynamic features with basic Bi-LSTM

Then,
- Static features can be added by selecting from correlation analysis 
- Attention layers are used to increase the accuracy of predictions and extract the attention weights

Experiments:

- Dynamic features 
- Dynamic features + Static features
- Dynamic features + Attention
- Dynamic features + Static features

Three Dataset:

- MIMIC-IV
- Sepsis
- Bpic11
